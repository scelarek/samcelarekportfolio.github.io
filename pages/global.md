## 🎯 Project Overview

This project dives into the historical global temperatures to shed light on the broader implications of global warming. By investigating patterns, fluctuations, and anomalies in the data, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the earth's changing climate.

## 📊 Dataset

The primary dataset consists of historical global temperature readings. This dataset captures yearly average temperatures across various regions, painting a detailed picture of climate trends over centuries.

## 🧹 Data Wrangling


Initial data was sourced from Udacity's sql server, and required several preprocessing steps:
- Managing missing values
- Standardizing date formats across sources
- Converting various temperature measurement units to a consistent standard


## 📶 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis began with visualizations of temperature trends over time. Significant climate events or anomalies were identified by observing spikes and drops in temperatures.

## 🖥️ Modeling

Regression models were utilized to project future temperature trends. These models help visualize the potential trajectory of global temperatures if current patterns persist.

## 📈 Discussion

When one separates the data into "pre-industrial" and "post-industrial" periods, there is very different global temperature trend lines, as revealed in the graph below.

This shows, that global temperatures rising is a relatively recent phenomenon occuring approximately after industrialization in 1820. The consequences of this trend are vast, influencing sea levels, biodiversity, and more. This analysis reinforces the importance of addressing climate change for policymakers and the public.
