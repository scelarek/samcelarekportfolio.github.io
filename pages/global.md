"How might we understand the impact of global warming through historical temperature data?"
</div>

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project dives into the historical global temperatures to shed light on the broader implications of global warming. By investigating patterns, fluctuations, and anomalies in the data, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of the earth's changing climate.

## 📊 Dataset

The primary dataset consists of historical global temperature readings. This dataset captures yearly average temperatures across various regions, painting a detailed picture of climate trends over centuries.

## 🧹 Data Wrangling

Initial data was sourced from climate research databases and required several preprocessing steps:
- Managing missing values
- Standardizing date formats across sources
- Converting various temperature measurement units to a consistent standard

## 📶 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis began with visualizations of temperature trends over time. Significant climate events or anomalies were identified by observing spikes and drops in temperatures.

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering

To enhance the insights:
- The data was segmented into "pre-industrial" and "post-industrial" periods
- Features like rolling averages and anomalies were engineered 
- Patterns were identified to gauge the impact of industrialization on global temperatures

## 🖥️ Modeling

Regression models were utilized to project future temperature trends. These models help visualize the potential trajectory of global temperatures if current patterns persist.

## 📈 Discussion

Findings reveal an upward trend in global temperatures, especially post-industrialization. The consequences of this trend are vast, influencing sea levels, biodiversity, and more. This analysis serves as a beacon for policymakers and the public to consider the ramifications of our changing climate.
