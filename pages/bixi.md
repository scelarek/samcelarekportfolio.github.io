"How might we use SQL and tableau to explore BIXI bike trends to enhance urban mobility in Montreal Canada?"
</div>

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

Using SQL and Tableau, I embarked on an in-depth exploration of BIXI bike usage data, aiming to uncover insights and patterns that could be leveraged to enhance urban mobility in Montreal, Canada.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The primary dataset for this project is the BIXI bike dataset, which contains over 500,000 entries detailing bike usage patterns in Montreal. It encapsulates data on start and end stations, ride durations, user types, and more, painting a comprehensive picture of BIXI bike utilization.

## ðŸ“¶ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA was primarily conducted using Tableau, which offered a rich visual platform for dissecting and understanding the data. Through various visualizations, I was able to discern peak bike usage times, popular stations, ride durations, and user trends. These insights can be instrumental in optimizing bike station placements, determining peak supply needs, and tailoring marketing strategies.

## ðŸ“ˆ Analysis
Deployed SQL with Tableau to craft an EDA dashboard and strategic report on BIXI bike usage. Key findings from the analysis include:
1. **User Patterns**: The majority of users are occasional riders, suggesting potential for marketing campaigns to convert them into regular users.
2. **Ride Durations**: Most rides are short, indicating BIXI bikes are used for quick commutes rather than leisurely rides.
3. **Station Insights**: Certain stations are hotspots for both pickups and returns, highlighting the need for higher bike availability at these locations.
