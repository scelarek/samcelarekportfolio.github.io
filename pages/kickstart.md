## 🎯 Project Overview

Crafted a thorough business report using SQL, EDA, and classification models on 150,000+ entries to set viable fundraising targets for a tabletop board game campaign on Kickstarter.

## 📊 Dataset
The data for this project is derived from Kickstarter's campaigns, encompassing a wide range of fields and attributes about each project.

## 🧹 Data Wrangling
Data from Kickstarter was imported, cleaned, and processed to ensure the integrity and consistency of the dataset.

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering
Based on the data's characteristics, new features were generated to facilitate the model's understanding and prediction of successful Kickstarter campaigns.

## 📶 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed using various data visualization techniques to understand the patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset.

## 📈 Analysis
Machine learning models were employed to predict the feasibility of fundraising goals, providing valuable insights for tabletop board game campaigns.
